# Arc-Fox
A `userChrome.css` style for an Arc-Like looking Firefox.

The style has several limitations, such as not being able to use the back and forwards page options when in hoverable mode.
(Side note, if anyone can figure out what's causing that and fix it, I'd be very grateful and would much appreciate the help.)

To install, place the `userChrome.css` file in the `chrome` folder (make a `chrome` folder if it doesn't exist) of your current profile. (Find your profile at `about:profiles`)
Then go to `about:config` and enable `sidebar.verticalTabs` and if you'd like a hover effect, create a config option called `sidebar.show-on-hover`.

This theme also has transparency built-in, but only as far as I'm aware, for macOS.
